# Cornered
Cooperate or you're a (poly)goner!

Cornered is a coop 2D shooter survival, where two players are circles whose only goal is to survive against the onslaught of polygons! The players are tethered together, and share the same energy pool. Shooting bullets or being hit by polygons depletes the energy pool. If it runs out it's game over!

Unity game coded in C#
